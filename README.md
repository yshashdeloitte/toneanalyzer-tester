# Tone Analyzer Starter Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/tone-analyzer-nodejs.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/tone-analyzer-nodejs)

  The IBM Watson [Tone Analyzer][docs] service is a cognitive linguistic analysis service that detects 7 tones which are most commonly used to detect the tone of written text. These are: anger, fear, joy, sadness, confident, analytical, and tentative.

## Getting started

1. You need a Bluemix account. If you don't have one, [sign up][sign_up]. Experimental Watson Services are free to use.

1. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool if you haven't already.

1. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change `<application-name>` to something unique. The name you use determines the URL of your application. For example, `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

  ```yaml
  applications:
  - services:
    - my-service-instance
    name: <application-name>
    command: npm start
    path: .
    memory: 512M
  ```

1. Connect to Bluemix with the command line tool.

  ```sh
  cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  cf login
  ```

1. Create and retrieve service keys to access the [Tone Analyzer][docs] service:

  ```none
  cf create-service tone_analyzer lite my-tone-analyzer-service
  cf create-service-key my-tone-analyzer-service myKey
  cf service-key my-tone-analyzer-service myKey
  ```

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the sample `.env.example` file using the following command:

  ```none
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
  You will update the `.env` with the information you retrieved in steps 5.

1. Install the dependencies you application need:

  ```none
  npm install
  ```

1. Start the application locally:

  ```none
  npm start
  ```

1. Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

1. **Optional:** Push the application to Bluemix:

  ```none
  cf push
  ```

After completing the steps above, you are ready to test your application. Start a browser and enter the URL of your application.

            <your application name>.mybluemix.net

## Troubleshooting

* The main source of troubleshooting and recovery information is the Bluemix log. To view the log, run the following command:

  ```sh
  cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```

### Privacy Notice

This node sample web application includes code to track deployments to Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker][deploy_track_url] service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

### Disabling Deployment Tracking

Deployment tracking can be disabled by removing `require('cf-deployment-tracker-client').track();` from the beginning of the `server.js` file at the root of this repo.
